synopsis

	The purpose of vpnstatus is to run this script while connected to
	a free VPN service and if this service disconnects you it will 
	immediately terminate a group of applications in order to
	protect you from a group of apps left running from your true IP
	address and not the VPN address. 

Example
	
	You connect to a VPN end-point in Moscow and begin a bittorrent
	but half way through the download of the torrent you become
	disconnected from the VPN endpoint in Moscow. The torrent
	download now continues to operate from your true ISPs IP address.

Solution
	
	If you'd rather that the torrent and other applications such as a
	browser left working on a particular website be terminated in the
	event that the VPN is disconnected then run vpnstatus.sh running
	in a terminal session as it will allow you to set a group of
	applications that will be terminated in the event the VPN status
	changes from connected to disconnected. 

code snippets:

# apps that should be terminated if VPN fails
processList=("transmission" "firefox" "pan" "slrn")

This section of code sets the apps to be terminated in the event that the
VPN is disconnected. My own suggestions are the following apps, but this
can be changed by you by changing the names of the apps shown between the
quotes, such as "transmission" -- a popular torrent client on Linux. 

# apps that should not be running under vpn
restrictedApps=("thunderbird")  

This section of code sets up a restriction on applications that should not
be running wne connected to the VPN service. My own suggestion is 
thunderbird, the email client. You can add more app names, each inside a
double-quotes such as ("thunderbird" "slrn" "other app name")
